About HA_Vector :
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HA_Vector is a C++ class with all the important functionalities implemented in vector class template.

The class has the following features:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Add item to end of HA_Vector.
* Add item to HA_Vector by index.
* Remove last element from HA_Vector.
* Remove element from HA_Vector by iterator.
* Clear HA_Vector from all elements.
* Iterators Support *, + and ++ operations.
* Comparing with another Vector( < , = ) operators.
* Get size and capacity of AH_Vector.

The Goal of this project is to:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Progress development skills to the level library developers who extend the language with new features.
* Learn how to develop a template library class.
* Learn how C++ vector works and how it is implemented.
